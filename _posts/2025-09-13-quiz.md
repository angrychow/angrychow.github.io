We consider polynomials whose degree and coefficients satisfy a natural number constraint involving their sum. By fixing the degree, the problem reduces to counting compositions of an integer into positive parts, which can be solved using the stars-and-bars method. The number of solutions for each fixed degree corresponds to a binomial coefficient, and summing over all possible degrees yields a power of two. Consequently, the total number of admissible polynomials is given by an exponential expression.

## Quiz

Given the polynomial

$$
M: \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^k,
$$

where $ n, a_0, \dots, a_{n-1} \in \mathbb{N} $, $ a_n \in \mathbb{N}^+ $, and

$$
n + \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k = t,
$$

we want to find the number of such polynomials $M$.

Clearly, $ 0 \leq n \leq t-1 $.

For a fixed $ n = n_0 $, the condition becomes

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n_0} a_k = t - n_0.
$$

Since $a_{n_0} \geq 1$ and all the other coefficients are nonnegative, this is equivalent to requiring

$$
a_k \geq 1 \quad \text{for all } k \in \{0,1,\dots,n_0\}, \quad \text{with } \sum_{k=0}^{n_0} a_k = t.
$$

By the stars-and-bars method, the number of solutions $\{a_k\}$ for fixed $n_0$ is

$$
\binom{t-1}{n_0}.
$$

Therefore, the total number of valid polynomials is

$$
\sum_{n=0}^{t-1} \binom{t-1}{n} = 2^{t-1},
$$

by the binomial theorem.
